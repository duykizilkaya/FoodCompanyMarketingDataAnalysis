Descriptive Analysis
Customer Demographics: Summarized the age distribution, income levels, education levels, and family composition of customers.
Spending Habits: Analyzed average spending on different product categories, overall spending, and spending patterns across different customer segments.
Campaign Responses: Examined the distribution of responses to various marketing campaigns to understand overall effectiveness.
Exploratory Analysis
Spending by Product Category: Customers spend significantly more on wines and meat products compared to other categories, indicating these are high-priority products for marketing efforts.
Enrollment Trends: There was a noticeable increase in customer enrollment during certain periods, which could be aligned with successful marketing campaigns or seasonal trends.
Income and Spending Patterns: Higher-income customers tend to spend more across all product categories, which can be targeted for premium product marketing.
Statistical Analysis
Chi-Square Test
The chi-square test was used to examine the relationship between categorical variables, such as education level and response to campaigns. Key findings include:

Campaign Effectiveness by Education Level: The chi-square test revealed that there is a significant relationship between education level and response to certain marketing campaigns. This indicates that customers with different education levels respond differently to marketing efforts.
Complaint Analysis: Another chi-square test showed a significant relationship between customer complaints in the last two years and their response to the most recent campaign, suggesting that customers who had complaints were less likely to respond positively to new campaigns.
Point-Biserial Correlation
Point-biserial correlation was used to measure the strength and direction of the association between a binary variable and a continuous variable. Key findings include:

Income and Campaign Response: There is a moderate positive correlation between yearly income and response to the last campaign, indicating that higher-income customers are more likely to respond positively to marketing efforts.
Days Since Last Purchase and Campaign Response: A negative correlation was found between the number of days since the last purchase and response to the last campaign, suggesting that customers who recently made a purchase are more likely to respond to new campaigns.
Key Findings
High Spending Categories: Wines and meat products are the top categories in terms of customer spending.
Campaign Effectiveness: Education level and past complaints significantly affect campaign responses.
Income Insights: Higher-income customers are more responsive to marketing campaigns and spend more across various product categories.
Customer Engagement: Customers who recently made a purchase are more likely to respond to new campaigns.
