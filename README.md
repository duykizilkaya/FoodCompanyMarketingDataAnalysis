This project involves the comprehensive analysis of marketing data from a food company. The primary objective is to gain insights into customer behavior, spending patterns, and responses to various marketing campaigns to optimize future marketing strategies.

## Project Overview

### Goals:

* Data Cleaning and Transformation: Prepare the data for analysis by handling missing values, converting data types, normalizing columns, dealing with outliers, and renaming columns for better readability.
* Descriptive Analysis: Summarize the main features of the dataset, including customer demographics, their spending habits, and their responses to campaigns to understand the overall data distribution.
* Exploratory Analysis: Use visual and statistical techniques to uncover patterns, correlations, and trends within the data, providing a deeper understanding of customer behavior.
* Visual Analysis: Create visualizations to illustrate key trends and patterns in the data, making it easier to interpret and communicate findings.
* Statistical Analysis: Conduct statistical tests, such as chi-square tests and point-biserial correlations, to validate findings and uncover deeper insights.
* Actionable Insights: Generate actionable insights and recommendations based on the analysis to improve marketing strategies and customer targeting.

### Achievements:

* Cleaned and transformed the dataset for effective analysis.
* Generated a variety of visualizations to illustrate key insights.
* Performed statistical analyses, including chi-square tests and point-biserial correlations, to support findings.

** Analysis Results
Data Cleaning and Transformation
The dataset was cleaned by handling missing values and ensuring data types were correctly set.
Several columns were renamed for better readability:
Year_Birth to Birth_Year
Income to Yearly_Income
Kidhome to Kid_at_Home
Teenhome to Teen_at_Home
Dt_Customer to Customer_Enrollment_Date
Recency to Days_Since_Last_Purchase
MntWines to Spent_for_Wines
MntFruits to Spent_for_Fruits
MntMeatProducts to Spent_for_Meat
MntFishProducts to Spent_for_Fish
MntSweetProducts to Spent_for_Sweet
MntGoldProds to Spent_for_Gold
Complain to Complaint_Last_Two_Years
Descriptive Analysis
Customer Demographics: Summarized the age distribution, income levels, education levels, and family composition of customers.
Spending Habits: Analyzed average spending on different product categories, overall spending, and spending patterns across different customer segments.
Campaign Responses: Examined the distribution of responses to various marketing campaigns to understand overall effectiveness.
Exploratory Analysis
Spending by Product Category: Customers spend significantly more on wines and meat products compared to other categories, indicating these are high-priority products for marketing efforts.
Enrollment Trends: There was a noticeable increase in customer enrollment during certain periods, which could be aligned with successful marketing campaigns or seasonal trends.
Income and Spending Patterns: Higher-income customers tend to spend more across all product categories, which can be targeted for premium product marketing.
Statistical Analysis
Chi-Square Test
The chi-square test was used to examine the relationship between categorical variables, such as education level and response to campaigns. Key findings include:

Campaign Effectiveness by Education Level: The chi-square test revealed that there is a significant relationship between education level and response to certain marketing campaigns. This indicates that customers with different education levels respond differently to marketing efforts.
Complaint Analysis: Another chi-square test showed a significant relationship between customer complaints in the last two years and their response to the most recent campaign, suggesting that customers who had complaints were less likely to respond positively to new campaigns.
Point-Biserial Correlation
Point-biserial correlation was used to measure the strength and direction of the association between a binary variable and a continuous variable. Key findings include:

Income and Campaign Response: There is a moderate positive correlation between yearly income and response to the last campaign, indicating that higher-income customers are more likely to respond positively to marketing efforts.
Days Since Last Purchase and Campaign Response: A negative correlation was found between the number of days since the last purchase and response to the last campaign, suggesting that customers who recently made a purchase are more likely to respond to new campaigns.
Key Findings
High Spending Categories: Wines and meat products are the top categories in terms of customer spending.
Campaign Effectiveness: Education level and past complaints significantly affect campaign responses.
Income Insights: Higher-income customers are more responsive to marketing campaigns and spend more across various product categories.
Customer Engagement: Customers who recently made a purchase are more likely to respond to new campaigns.
